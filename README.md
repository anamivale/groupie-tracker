## Project Overview

Groupie Trackers is a project that revolves around receiving data from a given API and using it to create a user-friendly website. The goal is to manipulate the provided data and display the information in a visually appealing and interactive way.
API Structure

The provided API is divided into four key sections:

    Artists:
        Contains information about bands and artists, including their name(s), image, the year they began their activity, the date of their first album, and the members of the band.

    Locations:
        Lists the last and/or upcoming concert locations of the artists.

    Dates:
        Provides the dates of the last and/or upcoming concerts.

    Relation:

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

    Data Visualization: Build a user-friendly website that displays band information using various data visualizations such as blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, and graphics. The specific method of display is up to you.

    Event/Action Creation: Implement events/actions that require client-server interaction. This involves creating a feature that triggers an action on the server, which in turn sends a response back to the client. An event can be any action triggered by the client, time, or other factors.
